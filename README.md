## About

**EnhancedCamera** is a simple AddOn which enhances your camera by enabling a custom behaviour. The default camera scrolls pretty slow and the scroll speed is static. EnhancedCamera changes the zoom behaviour to scroll faster while scrolling faster and additional to that, considers the current camera distance. The AddOn works without any Tweaks or options. 

 

## Requirements
